## DESCRIPTION ##
There is an emerging trend toward using video games as a means of increasing
patient engagement in physical therapy.  This trend is primarily driven by
the newest generation of consumer console systems which use motion-based
controls.  However, clinical research into the efficacy of these systems is
hindered by the inability to automatically collect data from systems and
software which were not intended for this purpose.

TheraWii a new piece of software that will give researchers the ability to
experiment and quantitatively assess the value of game-based therapy.  This
software will provide an extensible framework for games or interactive
experiments as well as an example suite of activities.  The key aspect of
this application will allow researchers to easily gather data from
motion-based input controls such as the Wii Remote.  Various reporting
methods and analysis tools will be provided for the gathered data.
